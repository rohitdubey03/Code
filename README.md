Introduction

•	Car Number Plate Detection Using MATLAB and Image Processing.

The ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) system is based on image processing technology. The main objective here is to design an efficient automatic vehicle identification system by using vehicle number plate. The system is implemented and simulated on MATLAB and performance is tested on real images. The system takes digital images of vehicles with their license plates visible and extracts license plate characters as a string of alphanumeric characters, and yields hypothetical user data from a related database corresponding to the extracted characters as output. The designed system is to work with reasonable accuracy if the digital image is of good resolution, and vehicle license plate has standard font in the region of interest.

•	Brain Tumor Extraction from MRI Images Using MATLAB (Ongoing)

The main theme of the project is to extract the brain tumors from the MRI images with some noise removal functions, segmentation and morphological operations which are the basic concepts of image processing using MATLAB software. The brain tumor detection is a great help for the physicians and a boon for the medical imaging and industries working on the production of MRI imaging. The extracted tumor can be classified to be malignant or benign in the future.
